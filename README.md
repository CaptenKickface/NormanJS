# Overview

Norman Site is a website that shows users the difficulty in navigating a poorly designed website and the importance of ease of use. The idea is to get users to go to the website, answer a few basic demographic questions, and then challenge them with a scavenger hunt for things around a website. While the user clicks around, Norman Site will be tracking where they look. At the end of the process, data will be presented on the user and be compared with the average of all users combined.

This idea came from the concept of Norman Doors. A Norman Door is a door that doesn't intuitively show if someone should push/pull or if it's accessed on the left or right. A pull door naturally should have something to grab onto, while a push door simply needs a panel indicating a place to push (usually a metal plate). To tell which side to use, the door should only have something on that side. This concept is a passion of mine because most people feel dumb for misusing a door, when in reality it's the door-maker's fault for making an unintuitive design. I believe the Norman Door effect applies everywhere, and considerably in tech. I want to show users that it's not solely their fault they can't find something on a website, but that the designer shares some if not all the blame.
